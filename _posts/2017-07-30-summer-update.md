Woo. This has been one of the most fulfilling, intense summers I've had. 

When I transferred to Lehman to finish my CS degree, I pretty much went full steam ahead. I knew I wanted to do CS but didn't know what
exactly I wanted to with it except for the bits and pieces of interesting information about job titles I've picked across my past work
experience.

Slowly, I found myself more drawn to the world of data and when I found myself building datasets well into the night, I knew I found 
something I couldn't let go of.

This summer I am a student researcher in the Microsoft Research Data Science Summer School (DS3) program. It has been, to say the least, 
absolutely life changing for me.

I knew I wanted to work in data, that I loved helping people, that I wanted to make some impact with tech, and that I wanted to get a 
graduate degree to continue learning, and teach on the side while hopefully getting to speak at conferences. I didn't know how I was 
going to connect all of that as I didn't know it was possible to do so many different things at once.

It is possible. It definitely is.

Being at MSR opened my mind to the field of computational social science and moreover, to industry research. There is an entire group of 
incredibly intelligent and hardworking people that work on hard research problems and also get to contribute to the development of products
like Microsoft Translator from the work they do! 

I am still processing.

I definitely want to make sure I can work with data more and am looking forward to connecting with companies that share my interests so
I can learn from them as an intern and get better each time so I may be able to contribute as much as I can.

This summer program has taught me many important things like choosing what's important to work on, figuring out what questions you want 
answered, and performing sanity checks for yourself and your research, as well as having fun with what you're learning. 

I'll admit, the summer has also been a little stressful for me because I am also working 12 hours a day at my PT job during the weekends.
Most days I go home and sit on my couch for a few minutes to collect my thoughts from the day. This has made me focus on doing all my 
hard work during the hours that it matters.

Buuuut, I still dream about data frames so there's no escaping work you love. :)

This week we're all presenting our research and what we have learned so far from the data we have been working with. It's bittersweet to
finish the program but I am excited to take what I have learned and apply it to projects I've been thinking about.

Right, the second web scraper. So, I built another one for a small grant project so I can get articles and create my own dataset for 
sentiment analysis. It was for articles from the NYPost and I was searching for how the media described the Bronx. Short story: not well.
I'll have to compare to other boroughs like Manhattan for a more concrete analysis.

I was very happy to be able to reuse the code I had for my original webscraper and just tweaked a few things. I'll upload when I finally
get to charging my Macbook.

Hoping for a mega series of updates at the end of the summer. Once this summer program is over I will be headed off to Florida for a 
couple of days to reset. Then, it's back to work!
