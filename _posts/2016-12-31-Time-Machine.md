title: Tracking Quality Coding Time
excerpt_separator: <!--more-->

When I was teaching myself front-end development through programs like [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/), [Bento](https://bento.io/), and [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/) I used a time tracker to capture data on not only the quantity of time but the quality of time I was spending coding.

I used [Toggl](https://www.toggl.com/app/timer) to capture this data and it was incredible for me to see exactly where my time was going and how it was being used. 

I knew for sure that my best working days were Sundays because while I still worked my desk job on Sundays, the job was usually slow enough that I could get a lot accomplished during my 12-hour shift. However, I wasn't sure how I was spending that time.

Here's an example of a typical Sunday teaching myself to code looks like.

Web dev 1 refers to the project I have these tasks filed under. I used 2 hours, 40 minutes, and 50 seconds in total learning jQuery. 

Of those almost 3 hours, I used an average of 21:03.67 minutes on chunked tasks. That's a great average considering I use a 20 minute pomodoro on a lot of tasks when I have undivided time to devote to something. Most of my Sundays tracked through Toggl look like this and I noticed that most of the time I would start my learning/coding around 10AM to 11AM so I knew those were the best times for me to get my brain to start focusing on tasks. 

That makes perfect sense considering I used to start my shifts at 7AM on Sundays and am usually fully alert and ready to go about 3 hours after waking up.

These are things I had pretty much already figured out and it was great to see this data back up my assumptions. 

However, the real beauty was seeing how coding on weekdays was working for me. In short, it did not. I already knew coding on weekdays while working my day job was an up-hill battle but I actually thought I was getting good work done. Oh, how wrong I was.

Take a look at a typical Monday with just under an hour of coding done.

Here's a different Monday in May with a similar pattern.

And here's a look at a regular Wednesday where I got three hours of work down on several tasks in a similar pattern of small chunks of time.

See the problem? None of these days I was able to get any coding done for more than an average of 5 minutes or so. There was a slim chance I was going to learn anything substantial that was going to stick in just 5 minutes but I kept coding during any free time I could get during work hours in the months of April and May. Working 6 days a week also made it difficult for me to do any coding on my day off when all I wanted to do was rest.

Slowly, I became more and more disappointed in the irregular chunks of time I was getting to code and I stopped tracking my time altogether. I figured I was going to learn one way or another and I didn't need to track my time to do so.

Now that I am learning Java I am remembering what made me want to track my time in the first place and running away from whatever reality the results gave me didn't help me at all.

While I was tracking time I held myself accountable and responsible for any time wasted. I stopped the clock when I was getting distracted and needed a break and would look back at it during particular bursts of energy and motivation and smiled when I saw how much quality time I was actually putting in. 

Don't get me wrong. It's not that I care about the amount of hours I am putting in; I care that I am putting in quality time. 

This quantifiable data allows me to see for myself the progress I am making and attach some logic to the days when I don't feel like I am doing anything right. 

Did I start and stop multiple times during those days? What was going on during that time in my life or in that time? 

What about when I was a non-stop coding machine for hours straight? What was I working on and around what time? Did the time of day make a difference?

These are external factors that in the moment have no real meaning but paired with actual numbers, they develop into a story that allows me to see a granular picture of my progress and thus helps me to make any changes to accelerate that progress and increase my productivity.

Right now, I am starting to lose track of how much time I am actually programming, developing, and coding and it's bothering me. Since switching jobs I have more time to work on side projects and advance my learning but I have no idea how much and how well I am using my time to do so. I am going to do something about it.

In the end, I want to make sure that whatever time I spend, I am actually gaining and advancing my knowledge and skills in an applicable way. It's going to be great to see those numbers again to prove it.

It's time to get back to work.
