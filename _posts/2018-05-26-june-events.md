### [FREE] 500 Women Scientists' Wikipedia Edit-a-Thon

_Sat, June 2, 2018, 2:00 PM – 5:00 PM @ Caveat_

87% of Wikipedia editors are men. So it’s no surprise most of the scientists on Wikipedia are pale, stale, and male. 500 Women Scientists is working to change that — transforming the idea of what a scientist looks like, online and IRL. Join them at Caveat to learn more about the contributions of trailblazing women scientists while editing the Wikipedia pages they deserve. *no experience Wikipedia or web editing needed!*

*Bring your laptop and your sense of righteous indignation*

Join The Data Incubator and Tricia Wang, co-founder of Sudden Compass, for the next installment of our free online webinar series, Data Science in 30 Minutes: Why Big Data Needs Thick Data.

Abstract: Why do so many companies make bad decisions, even with access to unprecedented amounts of data? Tricia has the answer: companies are implementing “big data” without what she calls the secret, missing ingredient, “thick data”— precious, unquantifiable insights from actual people—to make the right business decisions and thrive in the unknown. She’ll share stories and lessons from how her company, Sudden Compass, advises and teaches organizations to unlock insights from big data and turn their big data projects from optimizing the bottom-line to driving growth.
