Join Pratt Center's GIS Specialist Sadra Shahab on July 26th for a complimentary training on how you and your organization can maximize Pratt Center’s Neighborhood Data Portal to visualize data in an impactful way and practice data-responsive program design.

What you’ll learn:

* Get to know and work with a variety of demographic and non-demographic data layers
* Master the capabilities of all tools
* How to draw on and customize your own map for print
* How to select data and export selected information as excel tables, which allows for greater data processing and other visualization options

While this training will focus on the fundamentals of using the data portal, we will also include tips and insights into how spatial data can strengthen and support healthy program development.

Space is limited, so please RSVP. There is no cap on the number of attendees from one single organization, but if you are interested in bringing a group of five or more, please contact Salvador Muñoz at Pratt Center ([smunoz@prattcenter.net](mailto:smunoz@prattcenter.net)) so we can accommodate you better. All attendees are encouraged to bring laptops to access the portal while the training runs. There will be Wi-Fi access. Light food and refreshments will be served.

**The Neighborhood Data Portal**

Created in 2016, the Neighborhood Data Portal (NDP) is a free online application that integrates nearly three dozen vital datasets to break down New York City’s neighborhoods by the numbers. By democratizing access to essential planning tools like mapping and data analysis, the portal advances Pratt Center's mission to support low-moderate income communities to plan for the future they want to see. Essential updgrades made to the platform in 2018 now give users, especially staff at community-based organizations, greater analytical control over the data they need to develop responsive, impactful programs and customize and share their work.

Civic Women is proud to present Woke Work, a panel of five outstanding women of color including our moderator Ivelyse Andino, CEO and Founder of [Radical Health](http://www.radical-health.com/).

"Labeled as divas, angry, bitter, and strong — none of which are considered positive attributes — women of color often find themselves confronted with the unfortunate dilemma of whether to illuminate their voices." -Karima Mariama-Arthur, an attorney and founder of executive consulting firm WordSmithRapport. (Forbes)

Mental health is a real issue, and it affects our everyday lives. As women of color (WOC) not only do we struggle at home and at work, we suffer in silence.

Throughout this event, we’ll discuss the impact of mental health on women of color and explore resources and best practices for attendees to protect and promote their mental health in the workplace. This includes how to approach difficult conversations, holistic treatments and self-care, and maintaining a healthy work-life balance.

While this panel is geared toward WOC, we welcome all women and our male allies. We strive to create an inclusive community and welcome trans, genderqueer, and non-binary people to all events.
