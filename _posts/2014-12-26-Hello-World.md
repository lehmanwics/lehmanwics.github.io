I am participating in the #30daysofcode challenge set up for the members of NSBE-SHPE at Lehman College. 

The goal of this challenge is to keep us coding, honing, making, creating, discovering, and learning over the next 30 days and inspire each other to keep building even after the 30 days are up. The challenge is for all coders, makers, and designers. Doesn't matter if you're designing your portfolio site, teaching yourself networking or data science fundamentals, practicing for a technical exam, or creating a web or mobile app; practice is the name of the game!

The challenge I set out for myself is to work on the following three Java projects:

I am starting with the first program which I'll call **Fello**. I have started a repo for it here: [https://github.com/seerocode/Fello](https://github.com/seerocode/Fello "GitHub Repo for Fello Program")

I don't know anything about Java file I/O yet so this will be a great way for me to learn. I've got this video from TheNewBoston queued up to get started:
