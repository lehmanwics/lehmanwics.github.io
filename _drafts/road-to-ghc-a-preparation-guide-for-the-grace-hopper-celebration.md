So you're going to the Grace Hopper Celebration. Congratulations!

This post is here to help you make the most of your experience. Whether your goal is to attend the talks and workshops, meet professors and students in academia, network with other women in tech, or land a job/internships; we hope to guide you to that goal.

First things, first: packing.

## What to Bring:

Pack light for the conference. 

You will bring home **tons** of swag! Last year, my bag was packed to the brim with water bottles, totes, t-shirts, puzzles, exercise bands, travel bottles, etc. Anything you can think of, I brought it home. 

#### Luggage

Since the trip is only three days, you can get away with bringing a large backpack or duffel. However, I would advise instead to pack a **light backpack** that's comfortable to carry around with you at the conference.

Yes, you want something to wear on your back because you'll be toting around resumes, business cards, possibly a scarf or sweater if it gets cold, and of course, your free conference swag. It's going to get tiresome to carry all of that in your hands.

The second and last piece of luggage is a **carry-on duffel or rolling suitcase/tote** to bring on the plane. This _should not be checked luggage_. Avoid your luggage getting lost and your conference attire getting lost with it. Make sure the duffel or tote meet's your airline's requirements for carry-on baggage.

#### Electronics

Next, bring a **laptop and laptop charger** with you. If you don't have a laptop, that's okay. The business center at your hotel should have computers available for you to access and print documents. If you're staying at a popular hotel, you'll want to get to the business center early in the morning.

Don't forget your phone and email on it as well as **2** chargers! Yes, two. One to bring to the conference (which you may or may not lose) and one to leave in your hotel room. You can probably count on picking up a free charger from conference swag too!

Consider packing an e-reader or iPad for the plane ride. Whatever you prefer. Paper books are great too :)

### Attire

The conference is pretty laid back in terms of dress and the attire I've seen ranges from business professional (usually speakers) to casual. You want to be somewhere in the middle of this.

If you are interviewing or expecting to interview at GHC, ask the company rep about interview attire so you can gauge what's appropriate for the interview.

For bottoms, err on the side of caution and pack **two semi-dressy pants (think chinos) or a flattering skirt** (about knee-length), if you prefer. **Dresses** are perfectly fine too! 

For tops, pack **two blouses (or at least 1)**. Doesn't have to be fancy in any way or overly dressy. 

In general, you'll find you can probably get away with a t-shirt and jeans the entire team but it really does depend on the company you're interviewing with. Business casual is a good "in the middle" bet so you're not overdressed or under-dressed.

Besides, you will have enough t-shirts from swag to wear throughout the conference! Just in case, have a t-shirt you can throw on and a pair of jeans to switch into for night events and dinners.

For **shoes**, one pair of **nice flats** that are comfortable to walk around in as well as a **pair of sneakers** is great. Socks as well for those sneakers.

For the airport, wear some shoes you can easily remove (ideally those sneakers just mentioned) and whatever clothes are comfortable to sit in for several hours. 

**Flip-flops** for the shower. Thank me later.

This is the bare minimum. You should wear whatever you feel most comfortable in that represents you. Of course, you are welcomed to bring more clothing with you but leave some room for whatever you will be taking back with you. 

Bonus: your hotel may have a pool you can take a relaxing swim in later! Drop in a swimsuit for good measure.

### Essentials

**Resumes** and a nice padfolio. The 99 cent store usually has these for cheap. Otherwise, pick up a plastic and rigid folder to hold those resumes in. Count on bringing at least 40 copies just to be sure. Also check how many companies you're interested in and bring enough to cover all of them. You will have some resumes left over and that's okay.

**Paper and pen (or two)**. You might find yourself taking notes during an interview or session. Alternatively, bring your laptop to take notes. However, I find using my phone or laptop to take notes makes it seem like I'm distracted and impolite.

**Toiletries** like toothpaste, toothbrush, lotion, and hair-care products in travel-sized containers. 

Fellow curly haired gals, hotel toiletries will _ruin_ your hair. I pack my Deva-Curl and Tahlia Waajid concoction in a small travel bottle. My hair usually lasts 3 days worn natural so I can get away with a small amount to wash and go.

_Should you wear your hair natural?_ Heck yes! I did the entire conference last year. It's hair, _your_ hair. Wear it with pride. 

If you wear your hair straight, pack your favorite hair styling tool because the hair dryer in your hotel bathroom probably won't cut it.

**Mints and mouthwash** because you'll be eating food throughout the conference and want to keep your breath fresh. You might forget you're chewing gum and forget to spit out so refrain from gum.

**Cracking the Coding Interview** or other interview prep material so you can get a few study sessions in before interviews.

**Water bottle** because although you will probably get a free one, the one you bring from home is already cleaned and washed and the perfect size for you.

#### Emergency Items

A small sewing kit is a good idea although not entirely necessary if you pack a back-up outfit. 

#### What NOT to pack:

High heels. Unless you're keen on wearing them all day long and can comfortably wear them for long periods of time without wobbling, spare yourself the pain.

Anything that could trip security at the airport. I once brought 3-inch blunt scissors (forgot them in my pens container) and was stopped by security to search my bag. Seriously.

**Do**:

* Light backpack (to carry during the conference)
* Carry-on duffel or small rolling tote
* Laptop, laptop charger (if available)
* Phone and 2 phone chargers
* 2 semi-dressy pants (skirt or dress OK too), 2 blouses
* T-shirts and a pair of jeans for dinner events
* 1 pair of sneakers and 1 pair of flats or nice shoes
* Leggings or comfortable jeans and comfortable top for airport
* Flip-flops (for shower and walking in hotel room)
* Resumes - 40 copies + padfolio or rigid folder
* Paper and pen
* Necessary toiletries (see above)
* Mints and moutwash
* Cracking the Coding Interview/other interview prep
* Water bottle
