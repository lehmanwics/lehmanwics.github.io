## Who's Ro?
Hi, my name is Rosemarie but if you see me around you can shout out "Ro!" and I'm more likely to respond. I am a lover of beautiful and overall good design (UX and UI) with users in mind, story-telling (with data), and civic tech for the greater good. 

I am currently pursuing my bachelor's degree in Computer Science at CUNY Lehman College with a personal focus on and interest in data science to become a data engineer. My other areas of interest include product management, web development, and user experience. 

I am also a member and 2017 president of the NSBE Lehman chapter. Our chapter is currently organizing our 4th annual fall hackathon in collaboration with the SHPE Lehman chapter. Check back soon for more information.

In my downtime I am usually reading articles I have saved to Pocket, re-designing my apartment on [3DPlanner](https://roomstyler.com/3dplanner "RoomStyler 3DPlanner") and Pinterest, attending meetups, trying to teach my old dog new tricks, and teaching myself new tricks as well.

That's a lot of I's so far. If you're still reading, send me a note and let me know more about you! 

## About this blog/site
This site was born out of my want to document the process of coding for 30 days. It is a challenge I started with the members of the NSBE and SHPE chapters at Lehman to encourage each other to code, create, and learn for a consecutive 30 days and continue our projects after the time was up. 

In between I am using this space to post about side projects and things relevant to the development and learning process. 

## 2017 Goals
This is what I have set to learn/do/document for this year:
