Women in Computer Science at Lehman College was founded to bring together women interested in technology and computer science at the Lehman campus. We aim to support, encourage, and celebrate our community of excellent women leaders and raise awareness of issues women face in tech as well as inspire women to explore educational and professional opportunities in these fields "beyond the degree" and promote their interests through community events, talks, workshops, and conferences.

**Who we are:**

Lehman College WiCS is a chapter under the Association of Computing Machinery. We provide a community where women can speak frankly and comfortably about issues they face in their career and academic paths and focus our energy and time to combat stereotypes, introduce women to digital skill-building workshops, and soft-skills building workshops.

We collaborate extensively with Lehman chapters of NSBE and SHPE to integrate all underrepresented groups in our local and global community in order to forge inclusive partnerships that benefit all of us collectively.

**Our mission:**

Our mission is to create a welcoming environment that will provide academic, professional, and emotional support to women interested in technology and computer science and create more opportunities for women at Lehman to succeed in a digital world.
