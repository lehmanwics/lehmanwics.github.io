<p><strong>The Neighborhood Data Portal</strong></p>

<p>Created in 2016, the Neighborhood Data Portal (NDP) is a free online application that integrates nearly three dozen vital datasets to break down New York City’s neighborhoods by the numbers. By democratizing access to essential planning tools like mapping and data analysis, the portal advances Pratt Center’s mission to support low-moderate income communities to plan for the future they want to see. Essential updgrades made to the platform in 2018 now give users, especially staff at community-based organizations, greater analytical control over the data they need to develop responsive, impactful programs and customize and share their work.</p>

<p>Civic Women is proud to present Woke Work, a panel of five outstanding women of color including our moderator Ivelyse Andino, CEO and Founder of <a href="http://www.radical-health.com/">Radical Health</a>.</p>

<p>“Labeled as divas, angry, bitter, and strong — none of which are considered positive attributes — women of color often find themselves confronted with the unfortunate dilemma of whether to illuminate their voices.” -Karima Mariama-Arthur, an attorney and founder of executive consulting firm WordSmithRapport. (Forbes)</p>

<p>Mental health is a real issue, and it affects our everyday lives. As women of color (WOC) not only do we struggle at home and at work, we suffer in silence.</p>

<p>Throughout this event, we’ll discuss the impact of mental health on women of color and explore resources and best practices for attendees to protect and promote their mental health in the workplace. This includes how to approach difficult conversations, holistic treatments and self-care, and maintaining a healthy work-life balance.</p>

<p>While this panel is geared toward WOC, we welcome all women and our male allies. We strive to create an inclusive community and welcome trans, genderqueer, and non-binary people to all events.</p>
